            <h1>Beyblade X</h1>
            <h2>Introducing Beyblade X</h2> 
            <p>Beyblades. Beyblades have changed and evolved miraculously since Beyblade Burst. Beyblade has gone from Beyblade Burst Turbo, to Beyblade X. The first Bey that Robin Kazami owned was Strike Hawk. In his city, Robin would train against many others and would win many Bey battles. But, when he traveled to Xenon city, he discovered that there was much more to learn about Blading then he had previously known. His first battle in Xenon city was against a pro Blader named Takama Ishiama. Due to his loss, Takama grabbed Robin's Bey and crushed it in a pair of large pincers. After the battle, Robin met Blader X, also an ameteur Blader. When Robin joined Blader X's team, Blader X decided to battle and go against Takama Ishyama. When Blader X's Bey (Sword Dran), and Takumi Ishiyama's Bey (Stone Mountain), were launched into the stadium, Stone Mountain headed straight for the center and immediately put up it's strong defenses. Meanwhile, Sword Dran headed straight for the X-celerator rail, and in the blink-of-an-eye, the match was over. Sword Dran had done an Extreme Dash and launched Stone Mountain out of the stadium.

            <h2>Episode 24</h2>
    
            <p>In this episode, Blaze and Jaxon launch their Beys into the stadium. Blaze, the leader of team Ygdrassil, had chosen to battle with the a Bey that he had created in his company; Soar Phoenix 9-60 GF. He made this Bey in the hopes of it being the fastest Bey to ever be created. Blader X had chosen to use Dagger Dran 4-60 R, who Blader X used during Warden's exam which got him the title of, "the fastest." The first battle between Blaze and Jaxon resulted in a draw after they both were knocked out of the stadium. In the second battle between them, Dagger Dran and Soar Phoenix both raced around the stadium. Dagger Dran attacked it several times but Soar Phoenix didn't even waver, or even move at all. Instead, Dagger Dran was forced backwards. However, Blader X knew this would happen, so he used it to his advantage. Dagger Dran went straight for the X-celerator rail and performed an X-treme Dash upon Soar Phoenix. However, Blader X didn't just do one X-treme Dash, but two, then three, then four, then five, until Dagger Dran was going so fast, Blader X did an X-treme Dash Infinite, and then Soar Phoenix was launched out of the stadium.</p>
